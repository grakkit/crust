# JX

#### About
It's the jQuery of Minecraft.

You will need grakkit installed on your server to use this. [Click here](https://github.com/grakkit/grakkit) for an installation guide.

#### Installation
Use `/module add grakkit/jx` to install the module, and `/module update grakkit/jx` to update to the latest version if necessary.

#### Usage
Once installed, this code will import JX to the `$` variable. You can however use any variable name, as this wasn't coded by an idiot.
```javascript
const $ = core.import('@grakkit/jx');
```
