# JX

#### About
It's the jQuery of Minecraft.

You will need grakkit installed on your server to use this. [Click here](https://github.com/grakkit/grakkit/wiki) for an installation guide.

#### Installation
Use `/module add grakkit/jx` to install the module, and `/module update grakkit/jx` to update to the latest version if necessary.

#### Usage
Once installed, this code will import JX to the `$` variable. You can however use any variable name, as this wasn't coded by an idiot. ***Shots Fired, Bitch.***
```javascript
const $ = core.import('@grakkit/jx');
```

#### Where's The Documentation?
JX is too large to cover on one page. Head on over to [the wiki](https://github.com/grakkit/jx/wiki) to learn more about each aspect of the library in detail.
